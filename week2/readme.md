TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Managed to do all exercises without too much trouble up until the looping sections. Google searching still wasn't the clearest in translating information back into the actual process.

Managed to finish the rest of the loops when I had a clearer understanding of the function append
The last loop script is pretty garbage lol
